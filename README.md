# jwcxz's Neovim and Vim Configurations

This repository holds my personal configurations for Neovim and Vim.

I almost exclusively use Neovim except in specific circumstances where it is
unavailable.  The Vim configuration is merely a minimal fallback authored as a
single file.


## Setup

1.  Clone to `$HOME`

2.  `make` (sets up symlinks)

3.  Install language servers (see `lua/config/lsp.lua`)

4.  Install `ripgrep`

5.  `npm install -g instant-markdown-d`
